# Earnest Apathy
## (Mickey Mullin's blog)
Home of the bits and pieces that clieave unto each other to product the poetry (sometimes) and prose (more commonly) at [EarnestApathy.com](http://earnestapathy.com).

It's a [DocPad](http://docpad.org)-based site that began its life as a fork of the [Syte for DocPad Skeleton](https://github.com/docpad/docpad-skeleton-syte).

This is simply a container for my content and framework. If you are interested in DocPad or the Syte skeleton, I suggest checking out the links above.

## Syte for DocPad

Syte pulls in all its data from external sources. It creates a static site that contains all of the external data, making requests incredibly fast (no need to ajax everything, which is very slow).
